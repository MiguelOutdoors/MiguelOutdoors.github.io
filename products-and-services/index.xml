      <description>Do you like this website? Thanks so much, I built it myself you know. At this time I only know how to do create static sites. And, my availability to do so will likely be pretty limited this year. But if the price and timing is right, I&amp;rsquo;d love to help you our with your online project!</description>

      <description>Online Print Store
I do not intent to make this a priority. In fact, as much as possible I&amp;rsquo;d prefer to NOT commodify my art. However, we live in the real world and if a passive income can be made that can help fund other decommodified art, then maybe this is okay. If you like my art and would like a print, whether it&amp;rsquo;s currently on the store or not, I can make them them available for you.</description>
