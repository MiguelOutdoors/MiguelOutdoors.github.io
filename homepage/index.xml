      <description>Miguel Outdoors is the primary home for documenting all that I love to do. I write about my passions, interesting places that I&amp;rsquo;ve been, and I interview amazing people that I&amp;rsquo;ve met throughout my life. The goal is to develop a long journal of music, art, movement, and a love for the outdoors that I can both remember for myself,Â and share with others. I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by people like: Ben Kielesinski, Elina Osborne, as well as all the amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve met here in Hampton Roads, Virginia.</description>
