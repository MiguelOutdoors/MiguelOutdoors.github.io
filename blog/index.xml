      <title>What is Miguel Outdoors?</title>

      <description>Miguel Outdoors is the primary home for documenting all that I love to do. I write about my passions, interesting places that I&amp;rsquo;ve been, and I interview amazing people that I&amp;rsquo;ve met throughout my life. The goal is to develop a long journal of music, art, movement, and a love for the outdoors that I can both remember for myself,¬†and share with others. I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by people like: Ben Kielesinski, Elina Osborne, as well as all the amazing people I&amp;rsquo;ve met here in Hampton Roads, Virginia.</description>

      <description>Intro too old for retrieving images. we must move forward to todays news!
This adorable little monster is my cat Ulee (OO-lee). He&amp;rsquo;s a rescue cat that I got when I was having a hard time with mental health about 2 years ago here in Norfolk. At the time, I thought that maybe some kind of emotional support animal would be good for my health.
Now, some people might say that it&amp;rsquo;s not a good idea to get an animal when you&amp;rsquo;re in that kind of place.</description>

      <description>Long time no see üòÉ
The website may have gone offline as of yesterday. I almost left it that way while I left for a camping trip. But I figured &amp;ldquo;a total social media black out sounds nice, but it may be a bit excessive&amp;rdquo; Beside, when the problems are simple and not too common they&amp;rsquo;re actually kind of fun to figure out! God bless Hugo.
A new website might be in the works, not for me, but for some good friends whom I&amp;rsquo;ve met this year.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to be a part of this world! But I&amp;rsquo;m also determined to still be apart from this world.
This was not necessarily the first piece that I wanted to post on the internet. It is however the first time I&amp;rsquo;ve had all the pieces together to get this post really well put together. I&amp;rsquo;m still missing a little bit of information, there&amp;rsquo;s metadata for this painting that I just didn&amp;rsquo;t get at the time.</description>

      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a lot going on right now. I had set a deadline for myself. My goal was to have had all the paperwork done and ready to fly today. I&amp;rsquo;m so close. I need to get my supporting paperwork in order. I need to register my drone. But I think I have literally way too many irons in the fire. I&amp;rsquo;m exhausted, and I feel like, while there is a certain sense of happiness with progress.</description>

      <title>Speech Recognition Software</title>

      <description>April 3, 2023
I am now using speech recognition on my computer to help write even when my hands don&amp;rsquo;t want to. Now this feels like a podcast. I think that the windows speech recognition software kinda sucks though. Whatever, we&amp;rsquo;ll try it for a while.
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
The word of the day is confusion. I tried to find out if there was a universal symbol for confusion.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m slowly taking my art more seriously. At first it was just me having fun with what I had or what I could get cheaply at Michaels. I ended up with a pretty basic plein aire paint kit that, while I do enjoy and love, has me limited to a specific size and format. From the very beginning I wanted to try and grow in scale. To practice larger format art just because it looks cool!</description>

      <description>I have a little bit of an itch in my eye. The pollen is making my eyes water a whole bunch right now. But that&amp;rsquo;s a small price to pay for all of this new life. I love seeing it, the color of new live everywhere you look. I love the light greens, the pinks, the whites. There is still a lot I need to learn about winter, but I&amp;rsquo;ll worry about that in 8 months!</description>

      <description>I was born in Mexico and raised for the most part in Norther Virginia. When I graduated college I moved to Norfolk, Virginia. The idea was that if I was going to be an engineer, I might as well be one near the beach! üèñÔ∏è Living here has been an absolute treat. I&amp;rsquo;ve had so many opportunities to grow. But only the future knows if I will stay.
Reading List Here&amp;rsquo;s my current reading list as well as a list of books I might want to read someday.</description>

      <description>Long story short, I was not having fun using Ghost as my website provider. So I left! But migrating an entire site, no matter how small, is an absolute pain in the ass. So, if you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it means I finished. And it only took me about 3 days üòÖüòÖüòÖ</description>

      <description>I don&amp;rsquo;t know what to write here anymore. There are so many things going on in life and it feels like we&amp;rsquo;ll never have the time to fully process it all. Timelines, projects, shows, and everything else that life has to throw at you. Lots of things that could be considered good and lot of things that could be considered bad. I am overwhelmed, and this is how I&amp;rsquo;m feeling, and that&amp;rsquo;s okay.</description>

      <description>I&#39;m too lazy to re-upload pictures for this again. Sorry. - M 2023-03-17
I recently decided that going to burning man is a goal. That getting there will be a project. And that while the ultimate goal is to get there eventually, I am currently more focused on the process of getting there. I almost had a chance to get a ticket this year. But I didn&amp;rsquo;t feel I was ready just yet.</description>

      <description>I started practicing gymnastic rings way more (Check it out)! I made a couple posts and am having fun on Instagram making content. Although I will admit that I do often get absolutely sucked in to just watching memes or inspirational reels üòÜ. But that&amp;rsquo;s what this site is for! To get off of there and on to somewhere where I have more control.
As a part of these rings, I&amp;rsquo;ve also been exploring circus culture.</description>

      <title>Grip-it Rope Comp 2022</title>

      <description>Post Comp I have no idea what day it is, but its the day after the comp. I really liked it. It felt really good to be an athlete, to feel like an athlete. I had a lot of performance, anxiety and fear when I first showed up. All the problems seemed surprisingly, not too crazy, but I kind of knew that they were sneakily hard. When we got to the first problem, I said, I had also told myself to treat it like a fun exhibition of my skills, the body, hanging out with all my friends.</description>

      <description>No Pictures here either. oh well
It all sort of when I accidentally took too many spider plants from a free buy nothing event in my local area. I was supposed to be two spider plants ended up being two bottles of saplings. And, lo and behold, two or three months later I now have 12 spider plants in my living room. But that&amp;rsquo;s just the beginning&amp;hellip;
I have purchased an app, orders pots and started reading as much as I could.</description>

      <description>I was really excited that I could make this website. But as soon as it was up and it came time to write, a whole new challenge became apparent to me. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t say I&amp;rsquo;m a writer, so actually making posts on this website presents a scary challenge üòñ.
Well I&amp;rsquo;m back! I think I&amp;rsquo;ve found a way to make writing a bit easier. As the tech entrepreneurs say, I&amp;rsquo;ve &amp;ldquo;updated my workflow&amp;rdquo; to make it so that I can do the bulk of this writing on my phone!</description>
