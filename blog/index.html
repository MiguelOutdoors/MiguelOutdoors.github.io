But migrating an entire site, no matter how small, is an absolute pain in the ass. So, if you&rsquo;re reading this, it means I finished. And it only took me about 3 days üòÖüòÖüòÖ</p>

There are so many things going on in life and it feels like we&rsquo;ll never have the time to fully process it all. Timelines, projects, shows, and everything else that life has to throw at you. Lots of things that could be considered good and lot of things that could be considered bad. I am overwhelmed, and this is how I&rsquo;m feeling, and that&rsquo;s okay.</p>
<p>On the bright side, I&rsquo;ve been enjoying so many fun new things. To include:</p>

<p>I think I will be retiring this site for now. I want to save some money. I will try to maybe do a static site on <a href="https://migueloutdoors.ghost.io/2023-winter-update/MiguelOutdoors.github.io">github</a>. We&rsquo;ll see where that goes. It fits what I do more and I&rsquo;m more used to writing in this way. Hopefully then more writing will happen. I forgot why I was even writing in the first place. Maybe I never knew. But I think I will keep going.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know you. Maybe I&rsquo;ve met <strong>you</strong> and maybe I haven&rsquo;t. The general openness of this site has been a great experience. Github will be that way as well. It won&rsquo;t look as pretty maybe, but it will be updated often! üòä. ¬†So we&rsquo;ll see what happens. <a href="https://github.com/MiggyL0/Miguel-Outdoors?ref=miguel-outdoors">Check it out</a>! üíû</p>
<p>And thank you for being part of this experience. It cost me about $160 over a year, a worthwhile experiment? 100%</p>

<p>I Loved It.</p>
<p>I recently decided that going to burning man is a goal. That getting there will be a project. And that while the ultimate goal is to get there eventually, I am currently more focused on the process of getting there. I almost had a chance to get a ticket this year. But I didn&rsquo;t feel I was ready just yet. Instead, when the opportunity to have a small burning party came up I immediately sprang into action and started to work on building a Man.</p>
<p>I had been thinking about doing this for a little while now. I had looked at <a href="https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Build-a-Burning-Man-Effigy-for-Less-Than-10/">this</a> article for inspiration and almost went to go get these parts. But I struggled to find these bird houses and instead decided to go for a different design.</p>
<p>Turns out, theres a while website for <a href="https://burningman.org/">the Burning Man Project</a> and they&rsquo;ve already done a lot of the work for a mini burn! After some reading, distractions, and a bit more life getting in the way, I found <a href="https://kindling.burningman.org/build-n-burn-your-own-man/">this article</a>. It explains in detail, how to create a mini man to burn for your own purposes. They even have a 1 hour video to help you get the project done (although I only watched like 10 minutes üòÖ). My mini journey had already begun.</p>

<p>I live in a small apartment and and have to be really creative with what I had. In order to print the 11x17 templated I had to go to work and do it there sneakily üòÜ. I was lucky with making the cuts. I have a friend that offered his space and allowed me to use his saw horses and jig saw. I bought some tools myself to get the job done just in case he didn&rsquo;t have everything I needed, but he did. Gratefully and as best as I could I cut out all the pieces. In the end it took about 4 hours on a the Friday afternoon before Labor day weekend, after 8 hours of my regular desk job to finish this up. From having this idea in my mind to actually getting these cuts to come out of a piece of wood, I have to say, this was the moment it really started to feel real what it was that I was doing. I went home that day feeling extremely accomplished. This was not a very creative work, but I made something exist that did not exist before, and it felt amazing.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it, at the very last minute. Hours before my event, the Man had been completed. It was now time to go and do the thing this was meant for. I put a bunch of paper and pencils in my bag and got ready to go. This is when I realized that, while I felt called to make this Man, I had done very little to find out how to have the ceremony. Since I made it, people asked me what we were supposed to do. I honestly felt a little embarrassed that I didn&rsquo;t know what to tell them. All I said was that you should:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Write, draw, or express yourself onto this piece of paper, so that it can burn along with everyone elses. Maybe you want to let something go, maybe you want to purify something, or maybe you wanted to set an intention alight with flame and community. Whatever it is, this is your chance to burn it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I witnessed was incredible. In the end, with the help of a friend (safety first when it comes to fire) we set the Man alight and enjoyed the moment before us. I am very honored to have been able to help make this happen. And I hope to try this again (but bigger) next year!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve posted some pictures here as well as on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/migueloutdoors_/">my Instagram</a> page. However, if you truly enjoy this idea and would maybe like to experience it for yourself, I highly encourage you to try it for yourself. Maybe you feel called to build one yourself, maybe you would just like to find a sculpture to add a paper to. No matter what it is, if you have a curiosity about this, I encourage you to explore it for yourself. Pictures do not do this kind of thing justice. Find out for yourself about why this is art. Find out about self expression, about love, unity, about community. Learn about whatever calls to you. And if you feel so inclined, let me know how it goes! I&rsquo;d love to see more peoples experience with fire and light.</p>
<p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Miguel</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><h1 id="what-im-up-to-nowadays">What I&rsquo;m Up To Nowadays</h1>
<p>I started practicing gymnastic rings way more (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cd8rw43lxFjAKlrvWS1wjxj0md3GvYx8UQCAdM0/">Check it out</a>)! I made a couple posts and am having fun on Instagram making content. Although I will admit that I do often get absolutely sucked in to just watching memes or inspirational reels üòÜ. But that&rsquo;s what this site is for! To get off of there and on to somewhere where I have more control.</p>
<p>As a part of these rings, I&rsquo;ve also been exploring circus culture. I want to read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43641.Water_for_Elephants">Water for Elephants - by Sara Gruen</a> soon. I&rsquo;ve been learning about flow art, having an &ldquo;act&rdquo;, fire üî•, and so much more! It&rsquo;s&rsquo; been fun, but its another rabbit hole that I&rsquo;ve only explored for a bit. Maybe I&rsquo;ll write about this in more detail later.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been having slackline pop-ups where I live, if you&rsquo;ve read this far (thank you) you&rsquo;re totally invited to come and hang out! If you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, basically I set up a tightrope at some public park and let people know that I am there on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/migueloutdoors_/">instagram</a>. Then, whoever shows up can enjoy practicing the silly art of walking on a ratchet strap just for fun! I try to teach if asked, I tend to do yoga there as well. And sometimes I just read. It&rsquo;s been a really enjoyable thing to do locally. You don&rsquo;t always have to travel far to go on an adventure outdoors!</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it for now, I hope you&rsquo;ve been okay. Life is crazy, but hopefully this is a safe place on the internet, and hopefully it can brighten someones day somewhere to read about a random persons adventures/experiences.</p>
<p>Bye for now!</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><h2 id="post-comp">Post Comp</h2>
<p>I have no idea what day it is, but its the day after the comp. I really liked it. It felt really good to be an athlete, to feel like an athlete. I had a lot of performance, anxiety and fear when I first showed up. All the problems seemed surprisingly, not too crazy, but I kind of knew that they were sneakily hard. When we got to the first problem, I said, I had also told myself to treat it like a fun exhibition of my skills, the body, hanging out with all my friends.</p>
<p>The first problem was an obvious crack. I was the last one to go out of a group of three friends, both other climbers flashed it their first attempt. I felt the pressure to flash, and the crack definitely intimidated me. So when I went up there, everything was going good until I got to the crack and I started panicking. I thought that I wasn&rsquo;t going to be able to get past it. I couldn&rsquo;t do what they did. They skipped the crack basically by just using their strength. And I quickly found out couldn&rsquo;t physically do that. I made the realization that I had to use technique and I went ahead to try for the crack move. It was <em>intense</em>. I cut my feet and I almost fell! But I wanted to flash it just like everybody else. And so even though I cut my feet, I had both of my fists in the crack, and I made it!!!</p>
<p>It felt‚Ä¶ awesome. That set the tone for the rest of the competition. I didn&rsquo;t care about the performance. I just was happy that I gave my best effort and made it! It definitely broke the ice for the rest of the comp.</p>
<p>If felt even cooler because at the time,I was currently nursing an injury. Not a serious one, but my fingertips we‚Äôre kind of sore from trying full crimps too much. And so I was nervous for the next routes.</p>
<p>The green was pretty crimpy and pretty hard. I think I did my best and I was happy with my performance, but I did not try that one multiple times for safety. In fact, I didn&rsquo;t try any more than once. I think I had trained too much the week before. But I was okay with the results. You never want to be out of practice. You want to warm up properly, but you don&rsquo;t want to over exert yourself. And I think I over exert myself a little bit and I ate, I didn&rsquo;t eat enough prior.</p>
<p>So I think next time I&rsquo;ll bring a protein bar. I&rsquo;ll eat a little bit more prior, but I still don&rsquo;t want to eat too much to where I&rsquo;m heavy. But yeah, it was a great, had so much fun. The two lead problems were tons of fun.</p>
<p>So yeah, it went really well. It took lots of fun pictures. I can&rsquo;t wait to post on Instagram about it and I&rsquo;m super excited to come back to more, more comps.</p>
<p>This is like the beginning. This is the end of the first chapter for me of climbing or maybe the second chapter. It&rsquo;s a great transition. I can compete on an intermediate level, which feels awesome. It was, it was just a really fun, great experience. Can&rsquo;t wait for more.</p>
<p>As this spring rolls in, other sports come and take my attention. And that‚Äôs totally fine. I love it. I can&rsquo;t wait to backpack, camp and kayak. And eventually once the summer comes around surf.</p>
<p><img src="https://migueloutdoors.ghost.io/content/images/2022/04/IMG_0659.jpg" alt="IMG_0659"></p>
<p>This was me the nest morning, I walked home from a friends house with a Gri Gri in my left pocket and a tacobell taco in my right. I put it on my windowsill and had it for breakfast the next day! üòÖ</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><p><code>No Pictures here either. oh well</code></p>
<p>It all sort of when I accidentally took too many spider plants from a free buy nothing event in my local area. I was supposed to be two spider plants ended up being two bottles of saplings. And, lo and behold, two or three months later I now have 12 spider plants in my living room. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning&hellip;</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I have purchased an app, orders pots and started reading as much as I could. I now have a small forest in my apartment. I&rsquo;ve inherited plants in my office at work. And, while the plants were originally relegated to one area of my living room, they&rsquo;re slowly spreading all through my space!</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>I also now have a list of plants that I want as well as furniture pieces specifically for them üòÖ.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been great, but I&rsquo;ll reach a limit soon, and as the initial wow factor settles down I think I will likely try to reduce what I have.</p>
<p>Luckily, plants make great gifts! Hit me up if you&rsquo;d like a plant üòÄ</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><p>I was really excited that I could make this website. But as soon as it was up and it came time to write, a whole new challenge became apparent to me. I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a writer, so actually making posts on this website presents a scary challenge üòñ.</p>
<p>Well I&rsquo;m back! I think I&rsquo;ve found a way to make writing a bit easier. As the tech entrepreneurs say, I&rsquo;ve &ldquo;updated my workflow&rdquo; to make it so that I can do the bulk of this writing on my phone! And the best part about writing on my phone is, I can use text to speech!</p>
<p>Get ready for more posts, about more different and random topics. After all, this is my website and I can post whatever I want! üòà</p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a picture of me hiking McAfee Knob (again!). It was a great time and I just wanted to share.üòÉ</p>

    <div class="col-12 col-md-6 mb-2 "><p><code>too old for retrieving images. we must move forward to todays news!</code></p>
<p>This adorable little monster is my cat Ulee (OO-lee). He&rsquo;s a rescue cat that I got when I was having a hard time with mental health about 2 years ago here in Norfolk. At the time, I thought that maybe some kind of emotional support animal would be good for my health.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/holdingUlee2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, some people might say that it&rsquo;s not a good idea to get an animal when you&rsquo;re in that kind of place. And for the most part, I agree. I wouldn&rsquo;t advise dumping your sadnesses and stuff like that on an animal. It&rsquo;s really not fair to them and there&rsquo;s not much that they can actually even do to help right?</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleeYoung.jpg" alt="">
<img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleePortrait.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even if the reason for getting him might not have been the best, he&rsquo;s one of the best things that has happened to me in the past couple of years. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t do anything to help solve the root of my problems, having him around was, and continues to be, so nice!</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleeLove.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been such a great little friend for the past 2 years. He&rsquo;s feisty, crazy, clumsy, and all sorts of energetic. I thought that as he grew older out of his young kitty cat phase he would slow down, and while it&rsquo;s true a little bit sometimes, he still as crazy as he was when I first got him. he cries a lot in the middle of the night and always makes stuff fall off of tables and shelves. And while I took a little while to get used to, and it frustrated a lot of the people that I&rsquo;ve lived with, I think him and I have a really good matching personality. I have a feeling that other owners might not like him as much because he&rsquo;s too crazy you know? But I think that this is one of the things that makes our bond special.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/miguelUleeMask.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a bunch of pictures of me and my boy in the past 2 years. I think he turns 4 around Thanksgiving. I don&rsquo;t know for sure since he&rsquo;s a rescue, so that&rsquo;s usually when I celebrate.</p>
<p>This blog won&rsquo;t feature him very often, mostly because I don&rsquo;t take him out on adventures with me much (although below I have a picture of him riding a bike üòÖ). I tried my best to make him an adventure cat, but in the end he just feels more comfortable and happy and crazy in the safety of his house.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleeRidingBike.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>In the future, maybe after I buy a house, I can get an adventure dog instead. But no matter what happens he is, and always will be, my boi üòä.</p>
