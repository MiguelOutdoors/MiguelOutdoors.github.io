  <p>This adorable little monster is my cat Ulee (OO-lee). He&rsquo;s a rescue cat that I got when I was having a hard time with mental health about 2 years ago here in Norfolk. At the time, I thought that maybe some kind of emotional support animal would be good for my health.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/holdingUlee2.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Now, some people might say that it&rsquo;s not a good idea to get an animal when you&rsquo;re in that kind of place. And for the most part, I agree. I wouldn&rsquo;t advise dumping your sadnesses and stuff like that on an animal. It&rsquo;s really not fair to them and there&rsquo;s not much that they can actually even do to help right?</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleeYoung.jpg" alt="">
<img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleePortrait.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Even if the reason for getting him might not have been the best, he&rsquo;s one of the best things that has happened to me in the past couple of years. Even if he couldn&rsquo;t do anything to help solve the root of my problems, having him around was, and continues to be, so nice!</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/uleeLove.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s been such a great little friend for the past 2 years. He&rsquo;s feisty, crazy, clumsy, and all sorts of energetic. I thought that as he grew older out of his young kitty cat phase he would slow down, and while it&rsquo;s true a little bit sometimes, he still as crazy as he was when I first got him. he cries a lot in the middle of the night and always makes stuff fall off of tables and shelves. And while I took a little while to get used to, and it frustrated a lot of the people that I&rsquo;ve lived with, I think him and I have a really good matching personality. I have a feeling that other owners might not like him as much because he&rsquo;s too crazy you know? But I think that this is one of the things that makes our bond special.</p>
<p><img src="../images/Ulee%20Spotlight/miguelUleeMask.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>Anyways, here&rsquo;s a bunch of pictures of me and my boy in the past 2 years. I think he turns 4 around Thanksgiving. I don&rsquo;t know for sure since he&rsquo;s a rescue, so that&rsquo;s usually when I celebrate.</p>
<p>This blog won&rsquo;t feature him very often, mostly because I don&rsquo;t take him out on adventures with me much (although below I have a picture of him riding a bike ðŸ˜…). I tried my best to make him an adventure cat, but in the end he just feels more comfortable and happy and crazy in the safety of his house.</p>

<p>In the future, maybe after I buy a house, I can get an adventure dog instead. But no matter what happens he is, and always will be, my boi ðŸ˜Š.</p>
